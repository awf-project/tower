Last week was a blast! I had many great discussions about AWF and AI in general at Symfony Live. 
These conversations convinced me that the AWF ecosystem definitely needs a way to share workflows. 

That’s why I’ve been working on [__workflow packs__](https://awf-project.ai/cli/docs/user-guide/workflow-packs/), building on the plugin concept. 
A workflow pack is a set of workflows, prompts, and scripts that can be installed like a plugin via dedicated commands.
The only thing you need to be mindful of is what these workflows actually do on your machine,
given the security implications of AWF’s execution.

Although I’m still exploring the best approach, these "packs" will hopefully help spread the word about AWF.

I also experimented with [translating SpecKit into an AWF workflow](https://github.com/awf-project/awf-workflow-speckit). 
This journey gave me several ideas on how to improve the agent component. 
Consequently, __agents will be the main focus of the next release__.

## Why should you use AWF?

I want to clarify my position on this, especially since my recent conversations were so insightful.

I believe AWF is important because AI should give us more time to think about how to improve our daily tasks and our work.
Like me, you’ve probably wasted a lot of time writing scripts to optimize a 5-minute task—and if you love coding as much as I do,
"wasting" that day felt fantastic. AI is a powerful tool because it allows us to create and maintain many of these "small things".
In my opinion, building a workflow is the same thing ([with a dedicated skill](https://github.com/awf-project/awf-marketplace/) if you want effective assistance).

My goal for AWF is simple: __AWF should be the CI/CD for your agents__. 
The more you use AI, the more you need tools to avoid divergence and issues: tests, linters, TDD, architectural violations, etc.

AWF allows you to run these tools—your tools—in a deterministic way,
stopping the process if an agent makes a poor decision. 
With AWF, you aren't just sitting behind your screen hitting "Enter" and waiting for the next prompt.
Using AWF is a quality constraint for your brain: __think about your feature, then build it with your workflow__.

Workflows bring peace of mind because, once created, they are consistent.
You design them according to your own standards. Same execution, same CLI tools.
This is more than automation, __this is industrialization__. If you're tired or having a bad day, your workflows will work as usual.
If you're stuck in meetings and short on time, AWF will run your workflow as usual.
__To me, that sounds like progress__.

## On another note

I’ll be giving a talk about AI once a week for the next three weeks! 
You can catch me at [DrupalCamp](https://grenoble2026.drupalcamp.fr/fr/events/grenoble/sessions/au-secours-me-demande-dutiliser-de-lia),
then at [AFUP Lyon](https://www.meetup.com/fr-fr/afup-lyon-php/events/313790803/?eventOrigin=group_upcoming_events), and finally at [Dev with AI (tba)](https://luma.com/devwithai).
I’m particularly looking forward to the last one; it’s going to be fun because I know many people at the host company.
We used to code in PHP together, but they’ve since moved to a GoLang... and as it happens, AWF is written in GoLang!
